#### Assignment:
You should write a PDF report (HTML is fine if you don’t have LaTeX) in the form of a paper with the following sections:
* Abstract
* Introduction • Data
* Methodology • Results
* Conclusions


Make sure all the images and tables have captions.
A minimalist sample of a report is in HW02’s folder (in the github repo): see file report.pdf. You report must be longer.
